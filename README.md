# Make your own program using OpenAI 

Here's a fun little program that uses the OpenAI API to generate a random fun fact and asks the user to guess whether the fact is true or false.

## Prerequisites

- Python


## Getting Started


- Make sure that you have installed the openai package by running ```pip install openai``` in your terminal or command prompt
- Before you can run the code, you need to replace ```"YOUR_API_KEY"``` with your actual API key, which you can find on your OpenAI account dashboard.
- To get your OpenAI API key, you will need to create an OpenAI account if you haven't already. Here are the steps:
- Go to https://beta.openai.com/signup/.
- Once you have created an account, you can find your API key by going to https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys.
- Copy the API key provided on that page and replace "YOUR_API_KEY" in the code snippet with your actual API key.
